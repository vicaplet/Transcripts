# Transcripts
Transcripts from live sessions

This repository contains transcripts from the different live sessions (talks, conversations, etc.) I am taking part to. 
The aim is to make the content more accessible to anyone regardless of their a11y situation.

Some transcripts might contain Q&A post sessions. 
Please contact me if you would like to make corrections or modifications to the transcripts, or feel free to improve it yourself.

Thanks :)
